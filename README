Ever been demoing an iOS project and had to enter your credentials in front of a group of people? If so, you probably hesitated for a second as you realized that the characters in your password were briefly visible in plaintext in front of your viewers.

BashfulPasswordTextField aims to solve this issue. It is a UITextField subclass that obscures the plaintext character so onlookers will not get a glimpse of your password. 

BashfulPasswordTextField can be used just like any other UITextField with secureTextEntry set to true. The plaintext obscuring feature is turned on by default. To turn off, simply set the isBashful property to false.

This subclass is meant to be used for demos and presentations. It is not recommended for released applications as it alters the expected behavior of a password UITextField.
